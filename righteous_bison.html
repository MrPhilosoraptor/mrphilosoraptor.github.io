        <h2 class="weapons_text">How Sidegrades Should Work for The Soldier</h2>
        <p>The Soldier is an offense oriented class that thrives in medium to close range engagements where
          he can make use of his weapons most effectively. The default seconday item for the Soldier is the Shotgun, being most effective at close range and able to
          output high burst damage. It's a great weapon to compliment his primary Rocket Launcher and can be used quite often. His other unlockable items should be able to 
          take away one upside of the shotgunm or some factor of its function, in order to grant an upside with the new item that allows for changes in playstyle.
          Much of the Soldier's weapons do this effectively, some even being secondary items that deal <strong>no damage at all</strong> to grant utility instead. 
        </p>
        <p>You can find examples of these items with cases such as the Buff Banner. The Buff Banner is an item that can only be used once a meter is filled by the user.
          This meter is filled by dealing damage to enemies and once the item is used, it grants the user and their nearby teammates increased damage for a short amount of time.
          this item is made with the idea of helping your team in pushing through the enemy's defenses. Similar principles apply to both the Concheror and the Battalion's Backup
          All requiring a meter to be filled with dealing damage to provide a very useful status effect to those around you. With that said, we can take a look at how
          the Righteous Bison functions with the video below or by reading the brief summary underneath.

      <h2>How The Righteous Bison Works</h2>
        <p>The Righteous Bison functions much differently from the shotgun. Instead of firing a spread of pellets that each deal one instance of damage, the Righteous Bison 
          fires a laser projectile that passes through enemies and deals damage as it passes through them. These projectiles each deal 21 base damage to the affected
          target. Typically these projectiles deal 42 total damage during one shot, meaning the projectile dealt two instances of damage. This can vary if an enemy is moving
          opposite to or in the same direction as the projectile, but 42 damage is what you <em>should</em> expect. However, this is where we start to see it's faults.
        </p>
      <h2>Why it doesn't work</h2>
      <p>As you may have noticed, killing an enemy soldier with the Righteous Bison takes 5 total shots at close range and roughly 4 shots against a lower health enemy at
        point blank. Compared to the shotgun, this is obviously much worse. It would only take a mere 2 shots with the shotgun to kill the given enemy at point blank range 
        and roughly 3-4 shots at most to kill an enemy Soldier at close range. This is also taking into account that the shotgun has a faster fire rate, meaning these kills
        occur faster. The damage of the Righetous Bison gets lower as the distance from the user and the target grows, slowly dwindling it down to do as low as 11 damage per hit.
        When we take all these factors into consideration, the Righteous Bison isn't as good at medium range combat as we might anticipate. However, if it isn't good at longer 
        ranges or close range, what is it good at? It could be continuously shot into a tight area like a choke point, but as we said the expected damage should be 42. Though 
        keep in mind my specific choice of words as "should be" because the Righteous Bison is quite inconsistent.
      </p>
      <p>Many players have expressed frustration from trying to use the Righteous Bison because of two factors, one of which has not been mentioned yet.
        The damage, while not horrible, does not often add up to 42 on one target like demonstrated. Instead, it usually only deals one instance of damage, coming out to 21.
        This is very little damage and is comparable to the damage of a single shot from the Pistol secondary for the Engineer and Scout classes. This is also with the fact that
        the pistol fires much faster and has a larger magazine size, making the Righteous Bison outmatched at every range it could be used at. Nextly, we have the attribute
        that had not yet been mentioned: The projectile speed. The projectile speed is incredibly slow for something that needs to be more accurate, barely topping the speed
        of the default Rocket Launcher; which of course fires explosive projectiles and deals much higher damage.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>What we have learned from this is that the Righteous Bison is not fun to use and serves practically no purpose in the Soldier's arsenal. It is in desperate need
        of balance changes to make it stronger. What kind of changes could we make? Well we can address them below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buffing the base damage. It is absurdly low and doesn't often get enough ticks of damage to be significant</li>
      </ul>
