      <h2>What is this about? </h2>
      <p>Team Fortress 2 has a multitude of unlockable weapons that players will earn by chance and by completing in-game milestones.
        Most of these weapons are considered viable to the average player in a way that makes them fun and rewarding to use, but some fall short in this aspect or are simply too
        good at their role. The focus of this website will be to inform you on how these weapons currently perform, how they are likely supposed to work, and what could 
        be done to improve them.

      <p>
        Game balance proves to be a complex discussion on its own, however this will not go into detail about the ins and outs of how to design a game, rather it will
        briefly touch upon these subjects to help give you an understanding of the topic at hand. This also assumes you have an understanding of Team Fortress 2 as a game, but even
        in the case you don't, more may be explained to further inform you about the design principles at play.
