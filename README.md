## Project Overview
This website will be used for a petition to make many balance changes to the ingame unlockable items for Team Fortress 2

## Target Users
- Team Fortress 2 Casual Players
- Team Fortress 2 Competitive Players
- Valve Developers

## User Stories
1.  As a Team Fortress 2 Player, I want every item to be viable in its own way, so that the game has more ways to be played.
2.  As a Valve Developer, I would want all players to be able to enjoy the game I helped create, so that it creates a better user experience.
3.  As a Team Fortress 2 Player, I want weapons to feel fun to fight against and while I use them, so that the experience is always as fun as it can be.
4.  As a Valve Developer, I would like to pull in more players by creating a better experience, so that it increases the possibility to earn more revenue from the game.
5.  As a Competitive Team Fortress 2 Player, I want items to have higher skill ceilings and better functionality, so that they work better at the higher level play I enjoy.
