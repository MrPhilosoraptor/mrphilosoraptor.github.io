      <h2 class="section_title">How The Ubersaw Works</h2>
        <p>
          As seen in the video above, the ubersaw is a melee weapon for <strong>The Medic</strong> class. It has a reduced swing speed, effectively lowering its damage output.
          In return for this downside, the weapon adds an additional 25% charge to the Medic's Ubercharge meter. This effectively increases the rate at which the Medic gains
          Ubercharge, but going for any melee hits with a class that is not meant to be in one-on-one combat can be quite risky.
        </p>
      <h2 class="section_title">Why it doesn't work</h2>
      <p>
        As noted, the Ubersaw effectively increases the rate that at which Medic fills his Ubercharge meter with every successful hit. The Medic normally takes 40 seconds of 
        healing his teammates uninterrupted for him to reach a full Ubercharge meter. This means the Ubersaw effectively shortens that time by 10 seconds with each swing.
        This puts it in a very powerful spot for the Medic's arsenal of weapons, as the Ubercharge is effectively his most powerful tool that would let him push through 
        powerful defenses by using the Ubercharge on a teammate.
      </p>
        The ability to gain Ubercharge this fast is simply too powerful. Not only is Ubercharge the most powerful ability the Medic has, but is the most powerful ability in the 
        game. When it comes to two teams fighting, a Medic almost has to use the Ubersaw because the enemy Medic would likely be doing the same to speed up the process of 
        gaining Ubercharge. Even with the Medic being the weakest class in terms of one-on-one combat, he can get close enough for one or two swings with the Ubersaw before 
        switching to his Medigun and activating his Ubercharge if those swings were enough.

      <h2 class="section_title">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The takeaway from this should be that the Ubersaw does not provide strong enough downsides to warrant the very powerful benefits it gives to the user. A slightly slower 
        swing speed doesn't make enough of a difference for the weapon to really be balanced. Below, we will go over some potential solutions.
      </p>
      <ul class="changesList">
        <li>Lowering the Ubercharge gain significantly. Likely to as little as 15% to make the act of taking swings with this weapon much more risky.</li>
        <li>Replacing the swing speed penalty with a greater downside, such as reduced max health.</li>
        <li>Changing the Ubercharge gain to a boost in the rate at which Ubercharge is gained by healing.</li>
      </ul>
