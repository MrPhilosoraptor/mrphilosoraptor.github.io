      <h2>How The Eviction Notice Works</h2>
        <p>
          In the above video we see that the Eviction Notice is a melee weapon for <strong>The Heavy</strong>. It does 60% less damage than the base value and slowly lowers the 
          user's maximum health while it is active to a minimum of 100. In return for these downsides, the user's walking speed is increased by 15% while it is active. The attack
          speed of the weapon is also 40% faster and with each successful hit on an enemy the user will gain a temporary speed boost.
        </p>
      <h2>Why it doesn't work</h2>
      <p>
        As you may have noticed, a 60% damage decrease is a very large downside. Something about melee weapons that many consider reliable is their consistent 65 points of damage 
        on every class except for the Scout and Spy. The Eviction Notice only deals 26 damage, which is among the lowest of any melee weapon in the game and means it takes 8 hits
        to kill a Soldier. It also takes 7 hits to kill a Pyro, a class that fights in close range. The Eviction Notice tries to make up for this poor damage with the speed boost
        and the increased attack speed, but holding out the Eviction Notice for too long drains your maximum health by quite a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the speed boost gained when hitting an enemy can actually very easily throw off how the user moves in the fight. This makes it harder for them to avoid 
        damage or even land more hits, and when they are losing health rapidly while dealing less damage, it makes the weapon underperform in its one use case. Lastly, the 
        max health drain is quite unnecessary when the user is already in a very vulnerable situation. Its easier for most classes to deal high damage at close range, even
        without their melee weapon.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Eviction Notice is a very bad melee weapon, especially when compared to the default melee weapon for Heavy that can get kills far more reliably. It needs to be 
        buffed in order for it to be adequate in its purpose. We can go over some ideas to buff it below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removing the health drain while active.</li>
        <li>Lowering the damage penalty.</li>
        <li>Removing speed boost and attack speed bonus to replace both with attack speed that increases with each hit.</li>
      </ul>
